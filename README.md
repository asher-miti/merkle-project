Merkle Final Interview Project

Firstly, thank you for viewing my project and giving me the opportunity to work on this over the last week, I enjoyed building this application and although I faced a lot of challenges throughout, I'm proud of what I was able to build so hope you/the team likes it.

My project is deployed and viewable at: https://merkle-final-project.netlify.app/ or alternatively you can run this locally by running:

npm install to install frontend dependencies

npm start to load the dev server

My thought process for working on this project was to firstly, focus on the design and how I wanted the app to look and how I would go about achieving this goal thereafter. I spent the first few hours working on design and sketching out ideas for the UI. With simplicity being one of my focuses of the project, I took inspiration and ideas from previous projects as well as looking through sites such as Dribbble. After this, I decided on the libraries/packages I would use which would be most effective, load fast and take up a lot less code.

Once I had this plan put together and knew what I wanted to build, how to do it and how to structure the app, I began with actually building the project. I faced a lot of challenges I hadn't previously encountered throughout the process, and how I went about solving these were by watching videos, reaching out to dev communities and reading through a lot of documentation. 

I had further problems on deploying my site due to GitHub not being case sensitive and having to remove and re-commit files to ensure everything ran smoothly on Netlify. I'm pleased with how the application turned out although I believe there are always room for improvements and I feel, given more time there are certain aspects I would love to dive deeper in and implement such as:

1.Creating a function to allow the Line Chart to be viewed horizontally for mobile when rotating your phone - due to the width of the chart, this would be a great bonus for mobile users.
2.Addressing some minor issues with responsiveness such as the table of data letting you know to scroll left/right on mobile
3.1 or 2 minor issues with styling once deployed that did not seem to appear when running the project locally
4.Perhaps some further features for the data such as analytics, settings, the ability to convert all the data (impressions, clicks, conversions) into their own seperate line chart for analysis per month throughout the year
5.Further features for a great user experience!

I'm still learning and would like to consistently improve my skill set and become as adept at my job as a Developer as quickly and efficiently as possible, hopefully within a company such as Merkle.

Thanks again for viewing and I look forward to discussing this project in more detail.
